```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(FNN)

```
```{r}
test <- read.csv("Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv")
#summary (test)
head(test)
#Admission_Predict_Ver1.1 <- read.csv("~/Google Drive/Year 3 - S2 Class Files/DATA 311/Project/graduate-admissions/Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv")
#View(Admission_Predict_Ver1.1)
```



##Logmod Analysis and Plots
Here's a logmod analysis. No variable selection performed though.

```{r}
attach(test)
University.Rating <- factor(University.Rating)
Research <- factor(Research)
logmod <- glm(University.Rating ~., data=test)
summary(logmod)
plot(logmod)
```
##Linear Regression and some plots

Here's a linear model with a few plots.

```{r}
linear <- lm(University.Rating ~., data=test)
summary(linear)
plot(linear)
```

##More Plots

Here's a bunch of scatterplots. 
```{r}
plot(test)
```

##Classification

How about some Classification?
Let's try knn
